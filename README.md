# Conveyor

## What is it?

A Clojure library designed to facilitate commuication between human entities
using computer intermediaries. This library will help describe a way for
all of these components to work together.

## What will it use?
Streams! Manifold will be at the very heart of this library. Nothing about
individual messages can be handled in tandem efficently, but entire messages can
be. As a result, the flow of messages between state changes and transmission
will occur as streams. Beginning to end.

There is a hope that Transit will be used to send data over the wire to other
servers and clients as well, but one step at a time.

## Usage

As soon as it has been implemented. I'll let you know.
